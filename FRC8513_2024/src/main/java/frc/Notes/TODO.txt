1) asap
    clean up auto switches, maybe make a template? lots of copied code
    robustness with no photon vision
        -increase photon vision and auto heading 
    resseting navx
    leds when intakign and shooting
    
2) teleop
    test climbing

3) autos
    test auto consistancy on basic auto
    discuss how to lay out autos
        multiple paths  
        action within path
        what autos do we want
        break up autos into paths
    simulate photon vision

4) before comp 
    make sure all programmers can explain code
    comments (javadocs?)
    drive to point
        pid xy or on the fly path generation??3
    tune heading PID - tune, does this need profiling
