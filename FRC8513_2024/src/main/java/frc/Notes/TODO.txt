1) asap
    robustness with no photon vision
        fix single tag offset
    redo shooter setpoint - comment in state machine shooting to ajust wrist setpoint
    way to ajust shot mid match which saves
    
2) teleop
    drive to point
        pid xy or on the fly path generation??
    tune heading PID - tune, does this need profiling

3) autos
    simulate photon vision
    todo:
        a_p35
        s_p17
        Mid_P213,
        Mid_P231,
        Mid_P321,

4) before comp
    replace tread and ajust wheel ratio
    make sure all programmers can explain code
    comments (javadocs?)
    resseting navx
    leds when intakign and shooting
    update photon vision
