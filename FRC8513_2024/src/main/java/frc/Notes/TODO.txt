1) asap
    robustness with no photon vision
        test enable single tag
    resseting navx
    leds when intakign and shooting
    
2) teleop
    test climbing
    test shot consistancy and redo wrist setpoints (move arm up?) for new shooter

3) autos
    diable photon vision and test basic auto of 1 meter out and back for accuracy   
    discuss how to lay out autos
        multiple paths  
        action within path
        what autos do we want
        break up autos into paths
    does mid_p123 need to be P213
    simulate photon vision
    some sort of Source_P87 amp_p45 autos? 

4) before comp 
    make sure all programmers can explain code
    comments (javadocs?)
    drive to point
        pid xy or on the fly path generation??
    tune heading PID - tune, does this need profiling
