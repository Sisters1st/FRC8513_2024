    resseting navx
    leds when intakign and shooting
    
2) teleop

        action within path
        what autos do we want
        break up autos into paths
    simulate photon vision

4) before comp 
    make sure all programmers can explain code
    comments (javadocs?)
    drive to point
        pid xy or on the fly path generation??3
    tune heading PID - tune, does this need profiling
