        break up autos into paths
    does mid_p123 need to be P213
    simulate photon vision

4) before comp 
    make sure all programmers can explain code
    comments (javadocs?)
    drive to point
        pid xy or on the fly path generation??
    tune heading PID - tune, does this need profiling
